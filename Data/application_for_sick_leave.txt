Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to request a sick leave from [start date] to [end date] due to illness. Unfortunately, I have been unwell and am currently under medical care. My doctor has advised me to take some time off to recover and rest.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will ensure that my work is up to date before taking my leave. I will also be available by email if any urgent matters arise during my absence.

I would like to request your approval for the following days off:

* [start date]
* [end date]

I appreciate your understanding and support during this time. If you require any additional information or documentation, please do not hesitate to contact me.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

Nitin Singh
