Subject: Application for Sick Leave

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to request a sick leave from [start date of leave] to [end date of leave] due to illness. Unfortunately, I have been unwell for the past [number of days] and am currently under medical care.

I am not well enough to come to work and perform my duties to the best of my abilities. I am seeking a leave of [number of days] to recover and get back to my normal health.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will ensure that all my tasks are completed before taking the leave. I will also be available by email if anything urgent comes up while I am away.

I would appreciate it if you could approve my request for sick leave. Please let me know if there is any additional information you need from me.

Thank you for your understanding and support.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
